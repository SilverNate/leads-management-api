# Lead Management API

A Laravel-based API for managing and forwarding lead data, with centralized error logging, Redis caching, and PostgreSQL storage.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Lead Management API**:
  - `POST /api/leads`: Store lead data in `leads_db` (PostgreSQL) and forward to a third-party service (e.g., Slack Webhook).
  - `GET /api/leads`: Retrieve all leads with Redis caching.
  - `GET /api/leads/{id}`: Retrieve specific lead details.

- **Error Logging**:
  - Logs errors to a separate PostgreSQL database (`error_logs`).

- **Security**:
  - All API endpoints protected with Bearer Token authentication.

- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL for both leads and error logs.
  - Includes SQL scripts for schema and sample data.

- **Containerization**:
  - Full Docker Compose setup (Nginx, PHP-FPM, PostgreSQL x2, Redis).

- **Testing**:
  - API tests with PHPUnit.

- **Caching**:
  - Redis caching for lead listing.

- **CI/CD**:
  - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing (with deploy stubs).
